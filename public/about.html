<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Dave Tresil, a self-taught frontend webdeveloper passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites. 
  I specialize in turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly experiences on the web.</p>

<p>My journey into the world of web development began summer of 2023 when I decided it was time for a career change. With determination 
  and a thirst for knowledge, I embarked on a self-guided learning adventure. I've since gained expertise in various web technologies,
  including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design.</p>

<p>I'm always excited to collaborate on new projects and help bring ideas to life. Whether you're a fellow developer looking to collaborate 
  or a business owner seeking to enhance your online presence, I'd love to hear from you. Let's connect and discuss how I can assist you 
  in achieving your web development goals.
  Feel free to reach out to me at davetresil@gmail.com.
  Thank you for visiting my website and taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to the opportunity to work with 
  you and contribute to the success of your web projects.</p>
